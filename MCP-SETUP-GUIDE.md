## üîß **Next Steps to Activate**

### **Step 1: Configure Claude Desktop**

1. **Locate your Claude Desktop configuration file:**
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Add the MCP server configuration:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "lawmatters-mcp": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["./mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
         "cwd": "C:/Webapp-Projects-1/lawmatterssgv8-8",
         "env": {
           "MCP_LOG_LEVEL": "info",
           "MCP_AUTO_FIX": "false",
           "MCP_WATCH_PATHS": "src/**/*.ts,src/**/*.tsx"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Update the `cwd` path** to match your actual project directory

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**

### **Step 2: Test the Integration**

Try these commands in Claude Desktop:

```
Please run a project health check
```

```
Please analyze the code quality of src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx
```

```
Generate a new React component called "DocumentViewer" with tests
```

## üí° **Available Commands**

### **Code Quality Analysis**
- `Please analyze the code quality of [file/directory]`
- `Please run linting on the entire project with auto-fix`

### **Component Generation**
- `Generate a new React component called "[ComponentName]" with tests`
- `Create a functional component "[ComponentName]" with Storybook stories`

### **API Development**
- `Create a new API endpoint called "[endpointName]" with GET and POST methods`
- `Generate a Supabase API endpoint for "[resource]" with authentication`

### **Code Review**
- `Review the security of these files: [file1], [file2]`
- `Suggest performance improvements for [file]`
- `Review all changes for maintainability issues`

### **Project Monitoring**
- `Start watching the project for changes with auto-fix enabled`
- `Run a comprehensive project health check with metrics`

## üîç **How It Enhances Your Development**

### **Before MCP Server:**
- Manual code review and quality checks
- Repetitive component and API creation
- Inconsistent coding standards
- Security issues discovered late
- Manual project health monitoring

### **After MCP Server:**
- ‚úÖ **Automated quality gates** on every code change
- ‚úÖ **Instant component/API generation** with best practices
- ‚úÖ **Consistent coding standards** enforcement
- ‚úÖ **Proactive security** vulnerability detection
- ‚úÖ **Real-time project health** monitoring
- ‚úÖ **AI-powered code review** with actionable suggestions

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Performance Benefits**

### **Security**
- Detects hardcoded secrets and credentials
- Identifies XSS and injection vulnerabilities
- Validates secure coding practices
- Monitors for dangerous function usage

### **Performance**
- Identifies inefficient React patterns
- Suggests memoization opportunities
- Detects performance bottlenecks
- Optimizes bundle size considerations

### **Maintainability**
- Enforces consistent code style
- Reduces code complexity
- Eliminates duplicate code
- Improves TypeScript usage

## üöÄ **Ready to Continue Development**

With the MCP server active, you can now proceed with building the document management interface with confidence that:

1. **Every line of code** will be automatically analyzed for quality
2. **Security issues** will be caught immediately
3. **Performance problems** will be identified early
4. **Best practices** will be enforced consistently
5. **Development speed** will be significantly increased

## üìû **Support**

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check the MCP server logs** in Claude Desktop
2. **Verify the configuration** paths are correct
3. **Ensure Node.js** is properly installed
4. **Test with simple commands** first

---

**üéâ Your AI-powered development environment is now ready!**

The MCP server will now assist you in building high-quality, secure, and performant code for the LawMattersSG project.
