# Domain Migration Guide for LawMattersSG

This guide covers how to deploy on your existing domain first, then migrate to a new domain (like .com.sg) later without losing functionality.

## üéØ Migration Strategy Overview

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment (Existing Domain)
- Deploy LawMattersSG on your current domain
- Test all features and functionality
- Work out any production issues
- Build user base and content

### Phase 2: New Domain Setup
- Register new domain (e.g., lawmatterssg.com.sg)
- Set up hosting and DNS
- Prepare migration plan

### Phase 3: Migration
- Deploy to new domain
- Set up redirects
- Update all references
- Monitor and verify

## üìä What Can Be Migrated Seamlessly

### ‚úÖ No Data Loss:
- **User accounts** (stored in Supabase)
- **Documents** (stored in Supabase Storage)
- **Database content** (all in Supabase)
- **Payment history** (Stripe data)
- **Analytics data** (PostHog/Sentry)

### ‚úÖ Easy to Update:
- **Authentication URLs** (update in Supabase)
- **Payment webhooks** (update in Stripe)
- **Email templates** (update sender domain)
- **API endpoints** (environment variables)

### ‚úÖ Automatic Migration:
- **SSL certificates** (auto-generated for new domain)
- **CDN caching** (clears automatically)
- **Search indexing** (with proper redirects)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Authentication Redirects
**Issue**: Supabase auth URLs hardcoded to old domain
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Update Supabase authentication settings
# Old: https://oldomain.com
# New: https://lawmatterssg.com.sg
```

### 2. Email Links
**Issue**: Password reset/verification emails point to old domain
**Solution**:
```bash
# Update email templates
# Set up email redirects
# Gradual transition period
```

### 3. External Service Webhooks
**Issue**: Stripe webhooks, API callbacks point to old domain
**Solution**:
```bash
# Update Stripe webhook URLs
# Update any third-party integrations
# Test all payment flows
```

### 4. SEO & Search Rankings
**Issue**: Search engines indexed old domain
**Solution**:
```bash
# 301 redirects from old to new domain
# Update Google Search Console
# Submit new sitemap
# Update social media links
```

### 5. Bookmarks & Shared Links
**Issue**: Users have bookmarked old domain
**Solution**:
```bash
# Permanent redirects (301)
# Notification banner during transition
# Email users about domain change
```
